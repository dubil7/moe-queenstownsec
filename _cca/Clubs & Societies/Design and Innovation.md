**More Information on the CCA**
-------------------------------

Maker’s club is a CCA that focuses on the joy of making.

Members are encouraged to explore, design and create. Learning through mistakes and enjoying the process of tinkering and overcoming any bump that arises.

The club currently offers a space for members to do craft work, electronics and 3D printing. Members will be exposed to a variety of projects and design competitions, and they may embark on their own personal projects, subject to approval by their teachers.

And in true spirit of makers, members’ passion and interest will shape the direction of the club. The club itself is a work in process, waiting for its members to shape and mold it.
