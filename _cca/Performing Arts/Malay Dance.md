Malay Dance has given me great experiences and different opportunities to explore the world of Malay cultural dance. Through dancing I am able to know what I am capable of and learn more of my strengths and weaknesses. After almost 5 years in QTSS, I found a new passion which is dancing.

For the future I am looking forward to learn more on Malay Contemporary Dance and other types of dances.
