2017 has been a great year for the Quest Band! With the belief that music develops one holistically, we actively engaged the Secondary Ones to join the band during the Secondary One Open House performance. As the band prepares valiantly for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentations 2017, many hours of hardwork, resilience and teamwork went into play.

They participated in many band exchanges, and even organised one! These provided opportunities for the students to hone their confidence, playing skills and leadership skills.

Also, the band had forged stronger bonds and new friendships within themselves and with students of other bands. The members’ efforts paid off as we managed to sustain the Certificate of Distinction (Gold Award equivalent) for the SYF. Performances at school events like the National Day enabled the junior band to showcase their competencies and confidence.
