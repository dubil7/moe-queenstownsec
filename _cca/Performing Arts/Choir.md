Under the creative direction of our conductor Mr Wong Yang Kai and the guidance of our teachers, Quest Choir has had a meaningful and fruitful year taking part in numerous activities, all of which have given us the opportunity to share our love for music, as well as deepen our love for the art. More importantly, making music together has fostered close friendships among our members, and strengthened our bonds as a family.

We look forward to developing our musicality and working together as a team in the year ahead. We Sing As One!
