**Student Management Philosophy**
---------------------------------

We believe that:

*   Every student is a unique individual, capable of doing good;
*   Every student should be treated fairly and respectfully;
*   Every student deserves the space to learn from mistakes and improve.

Our work is an educative process that instils self-discipline and good character in our students.

**Vision**
----------

Every Queenstownian, a self-disciplined student

**Motto**
---------

High Care, High Expectation

**Mission**
-----------

To promote a safe and conducive environment that facilitates student learning and well-being through a positive and proactive approach.

**A Positive and Proactive Approach to Discipline**
---------------------------------------------------

In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline in school, the school considers the three aspects below:

**Promote and Prevent**

At the centre of effective behaviour and classroom management are strong teacher-student relationships and quality instruction. Schools must promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, strengthen protective factors and mitigate risk factors to prevent challenging behaviours from occurring and disrupting learning.

**Address and Correct**

Despite preventive measures, students could still display inappropriate behaviours due to various reasons. As educators, we need to address the inappropriate behaviour promptly so that it does not disrupt teaching and learning, and correct it before it affects students’ development and well-being. Addressing the underlying reason(s) for inappropriate behaviour will result in sustainable behavioural change.

**Replace and Restore**

As the ultimate goal is for students to develop self-discipline and good character, it is important for teachers to help misbehaving students to replace their inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and to restore relationships with others hurt by their actions. This also requires consistent positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviour and peer support to encourage habit formation.
