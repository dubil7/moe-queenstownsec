**Department Reflection**

Despite COVID-19 and safe-distancing measures, the Mathematics department continued to create authentic, interesting and engaging activities for our Queenstownians. In October, the department teachers organised Math Quizzes through social media. Students were exposed to intriguing and challenging mathematics problems beyond the classroom, with the aim of developing their metacognitive and problem solving skills.

In addition, the department collaborated with IMDA to provide opportunities for the Secondary One students to deepen their computational thinking skills through exposure to digital crafts, coding and the use of micro-controller. Students applied what they have learnt to solve real-life problems e.g. designing movement trackers to encourage exercise and temperature and humidity sensor.

To support Secondary Two students to make informed decisions on their subject combination for the following year, Principles of Accounts teachers mounted a workshop, namely POA Outreach, for students to expose them to some basic accounting concepts and challenged them to create a business decisions for the toy they made. Students shared that they greatly enjoyed the process.

All in all, preparing our students to be future-ready leaders forms the cornerstone of the design of our programmes and activities.
