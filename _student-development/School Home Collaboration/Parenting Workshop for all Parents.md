For the first time, our Principal and CEO, Mr Soh Wai Wah will be giving parents a fresh perspective of educating your child for the 21st century at the upcoming Parents’ Forum. In conjunction with SP Open House 2019, it will be held on **12 January 2019 (Saturday).**

We hope that you can encourage parents with children who have just completed the GCE “O” level exam to attend SP Parents’ Forum to help them make the right choice in their further education and future career. Our Admissions Office will also be sharing with parents the different admissions pathways followed by a tour of our academic schools.

There are 2 sessions that parents could choose to attend:

Session 1: 10.00am to 12.30pm

Session 2\*: 1.30pm to 4.00pm

_\*Session 2 is a repeat of Session 1_
