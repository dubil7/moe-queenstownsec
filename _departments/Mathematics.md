•	Diagrams<br>
•	Equivalence<br>
•	Functions <br>
•	Invariance<br>
•	Measures<br>
•	Models<br>
•	Notations <br>
•	Proportionality<br>
</ul>
<u>Solving Problems in Real World Context (PRWC) Tasks: </u>
<ul>
•	Providing students with authentic context to work with to raise their competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling.<br>
•	Using Computational Thinking to approach PRWC questions
</ul>
	
##### **Key Learning Experiences**	
	
**WHOLE SCHOOL**
<ul>
•	Talent Development Programme: Mathematics Ascent for Higher Achievers (MAHA) <br>
•	Bridging programmes to prepare students to learn Mathematics at a more demanding level.
</ul>

**LOWER SECONDARY**
<ul>
•	Sec 1: Computational Thinking and Code for Fun <br>
•	Sec 2: Principles of Accounts Outreach 
</ul>

##### **Key Achievements**
<ul>
