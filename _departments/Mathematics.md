•	&nbsp;Proportionality<br>

<u>Solving Problems in Real World Context (PRWC) Tasks: </u>

•&nbsp;	Providing students with authentic context to work with to raise their competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling.<br>
•&nbsp;	Using Computational Thinking to approach PRWC questions

	
##### **Key Learning Experiences**	
	
**WHOLE SCHOOL**

•	&nbsp;Talent Development Programme: Mathematics Ascent for Higher Achievers (MAHA) <br>
•	&nbsp;Bridging programmes to prepare students to learn Mathematics at a more demanding level.


**LOWER SECONDARY**
