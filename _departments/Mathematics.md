##### **The Quest to...**
Develop every Queenstownian into an independent learner, and a precise and resilient thinker.

##### **Key Approaches**

<u>Using pedagogical practices in teaching towards Big Ideas in Mathematics:</u>
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Diagrams<br>
•&nbsp;	Equivalence<br>
•&nbsp;	Functions <br>
•	&nbsp;Invariance<br>
•&nbsp;	Measures<br>
•	&nbsp;Models<br>
•&nbsp;	Notations <br>
•	&nbsp;Proportionality<br>
</ul>
<u>Solving Problems in Real World Context (PRWC) Tasks: </u>
<ul>
•&nbsp;	Providing students with authentic context to work with to raise their competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling.<br>
•&nbsp;	Using Computational Thinking to approach PRWC questions
</ul>
	
##### **Key Learning Experiences**	
	
**WHOLE SCHOOL**
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Talent Development Programme: Mathematics Ascent for Higher Achievers (MAHA) <br>
•	&nbsp;Bridging programmes to prepare students to learn Mathematics at a more demanding level.
</ul>

**LOWER SECONDARY**
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Sec 1: Computational Thinking and Code for Fun <br>
•	&nbsp;Sec 2: Principles of Accounts Outreach 
</ul>

##### **Key Achievements**
<ul>

• &nbsp;**Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC)**: 2 Silver awards, 10 Bronze awards and 2 Honourable Mentions<br>
•	&nbsp;**Singapore &amp; Asian School Math Olympiad (SASMO)**: &nbsp;2 Silver awards, 3 Bronze awards and 7 Honourable Mentions<br>
