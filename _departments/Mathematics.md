#### **The Quest to...**
Develop every Queenstownian into an independent learner, and a precise and resilient thinker.

#### **Key Approaches**

<u>Using pedagogical practices in teaching towards Big Ideas in Mathematics:</u>

•	Diagrams<br>
•	Equivalence<br>
•	Functions <br>
•	Invariance<br>
•	Measures<br>
•	Models<br>
•	Notations <br>
•	Proportionality<br>

<u>Solving Problems in Real World Context (PRWC) Tasks: </u>

•	Providing students with authentic context to work with to raise their competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling.<br>
•	Using Computational Thinking to approach PRWC questions

	
#### **Key Learning Experiences**	
	
**WHOLE SCHOOL**

•	Talent Development Programme: Mathematics Ascent for Higher Achievers (MAHA) 
•	Bridging programmes to prepare students to learn Mathematics at a more demanding level.

**LOWER SECONDARY**

•	Sec 1: Computational Thinking and Code for Fun 
•	Sec 2: Principles of Accounts Outreach 
	

#### **Key Achievements**

•	**Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC):** 2 Silver awards, 10 Bronze awards and 2 Honourable Mentions<br>
•	**Singapore &amp; Asian School Math Olympiad <br>(SASMO):** 2 Silver awards, 3 Bronze awards and 7 Honourable Mentions<br>
•	**Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO):** 3 Honourable Mentions
