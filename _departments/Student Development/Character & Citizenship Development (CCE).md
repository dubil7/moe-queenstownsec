Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)
===========================


##### **The Quest to...**

•	Develop every Queenstownian to be an individual of good character with resilience who is future-ready and participates actively as a citizen.<br>
•	Guide every Queenstownian to be the best version of himself/herself while strengthening their self-concept and preparing them for the world through imbuing in them the R2ICE values and 21CC.

##### **Key Approaches**

The Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) programmes in QTSS emphasises on the school’s core values and aims to strengthen the competencies of Queenstownians so that they will be able to make sound decisions, therein fostering meaningful and positive relationship with others, and making a positive impact to the community around them.

Through the different content areas in the CCE curriculum, Queenstownians go through a journey to make sense of the ever-changing world around them: <br>
•	This journey brings them progressively through the years to explore their identity and role in the world as an individual and a member of the community, and eventually one where they impact the community.<br>
•	This progressive approach ensures that the materials will be relatable to them at every stage of their life in QTSS. <br>
•	Their appreciation of the conversations they have in class are reinforced when these conversations and learnings extend to every aspect of a Queenstownians’ life within QTSS, with elements of CCE being weaved into every learning experience and teachable moments. 

True to our philosophy, where the unique worth of every individual is cherished, and the symbiotic relation between him/her and society is recognised, we place much emphasis on the involvement of every Queenstownian in their own development and influence on others:

•	Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their voices in classroom discussions as well as other areas
