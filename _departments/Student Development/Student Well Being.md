In QTSS, we place the well-being of our students at the centre and focus on 4 different domains in the Student Well-Being framework to support our students and help them grow and flourish in school.

**<u>Engaging Curriculum</u>** <br>
•	Class Mentor Contact Time (CMCT) provide the platform for CMs to conduct school-based programmes, for e.g. Growth Mindset and just-in-time well-being packages <br>
•	Start Right and Finish Strong Programmes are facilitated at the start and end of each term to help students set goals and review their progress


**<u>Supportive Social and Physical Environment</u>**

•	Regular Quest Check-ins are conducted to build positive Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) <br>
•	Student surveys, for e.g. well-being and check -in surveys and social network analysis, are administered regularly to understand the needs and emotional state of students as well as understand peer relationships within the class  <br>
•	Class of Excellence (COE) Challenge helps to nurture a positive class culture for learning and affirm classes which have performed well. 

**<u>Student Voice and Choice</u>**

•	Students are active participants in their own learning and well-being <br>
•	[Student Voice](https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-voices/) is a digital platform to encourage student voice for school matters and helping them feel connected and valued in the school

**<u>Effective Partnership</u>** <br>

•	Families and communities collaborate as partners with the school to support student learning, safety and well-being <br>
•	Parent Engagement sessions and Parent-Teacher Meetings are organised to communicate level outcomes and focus at each level  and to inform parents of the academic progress of students<br>
•	The school also leverages on external agencies e.g. Family Service Centres to complement school’s support for students
