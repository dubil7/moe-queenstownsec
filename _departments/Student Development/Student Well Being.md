In QTSS, we place the well-being of our students at the centre and focus on 4 different domains in the Student Well-Being framework to support our students and help them grow and flourish in school.

**<u>Engaging Curriculum</u>** <br>
•	Class Mentor Contact Time (CMCT) provide the platform for CMs to conduct school-based programmes, for e.g. Growth Mindset and just-in-time well-being packages <br>
•	Start Right and Finish Strong Programmes are facilitated at the start and end of each term to help students set goals and review their progress
