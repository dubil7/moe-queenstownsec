The revised Science Curriculum Framework (Figure 1) encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to provide students with a strong foundation in Science for life, learning, citizenry and work.

The tagline **_Science for Life and Society_** at the core of the curriculum framework captures the essence of the goals of science education.

Our science students are diverse, with different needs, interests and aptitudes for Science. Given the diversity of our students and the needs of our country, the twin **goals of science education** are:

*   To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, which can help them to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives.
*   To provide strong science foundations for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

Surrounding the core of the framework are the three “IN”s, inspire, inquire and innovate, which represent the **vision of science education**. It encapsulates the desired overall experience of our students in science education:

*   <u>INspired by Science.</u> Students enjoy learning Science, and are fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges. They regard Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciate how Science and Technology have transformed the world and improved our lives. A good number of students see Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good of society.
*   <u>INquire like scientists.</u> Students have a strong foundation in Science, and possess the spirit of scientific inquiry. They are able to engage confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment. They can discern, weigh alternatives and evaluate claims and ideas critically, based on logical scientific evidence and arguments, and yet are able to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence.
*   <u>INnovate using Science.</u> Students apply and experience the potential of Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity. A strong pipeline of students can contribute towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise.

The outer ring represents the domains that make up the strong science fundamentals: Core Ideas, Practices, and the Values, Ethics and Attitudes.

*   <u>Core Ideas (CI) of Science.</u> To make Science learning coherent and meaningful, the Science curriculum is organised around Core Ideas, which are the distilled ideas central to Science. The Core Ideas help students see the coherence and conceptual links within and across the different sub-disciplines of Science (i.e. Biology, Chemistry and Physics).

<u>Practices of Science</u> serve to highlight that Science is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge; it is also a way of thinking and doing. The Practices of Science represents the set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated and established, as well as how Science is applied in society (Section 1.2 21st Century Competencies and Scientific Literacy).  In particular, it is important to appreciate that the three components representing the cognitive, epistemic and social aspects of the Practices are intricately related.

*   <u>Values, Ethics and Attitudes.</u>

Although Science uses objective methods to arrive at evidence-based conclusions, it is a human enterprise conducted in particular social contexts which involve a nuanced consideration of values and ethics (Table 1). It is important for our students to be aware of and appreciate the values and ethical implications of the application of Science in society. Thus, science education needs to equip students with the ability to articulate their ethical stance as they participate in discussions about socio-scientific issues that involve ethical dilemmas, with no single right answers.

The pair of hands in the Science Curriculum Framework represents the roles of students as inquirers in their learning and pursuit of science, supported by teachers and partners as facilitators of the students’ learning experiences, to impart the excitement and value of science to the students. The partnership of learning and teaching goes beyond the students and teachers to include other partners who facilitate learning in various contexts to fuel students’ sense of inquiry and innovation, to inspire them and to help them appreciate the application of science in their daily lives, society and the environment.
