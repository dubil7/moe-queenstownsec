##### **The Quest to…**


Develop every Queenstownian into a confident, creative and motivated learner. 

##### **Key Approaches**

The three “IN”s, inspire, inquire and innovate, represent the **vision of science education.** It encapsulates the desired overall experience of our students in science education.

<u>INspired by Science</u>
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Enjoying learning Science, and being fascinated by how everyday phenomena have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global challenges.<br>
•	&nbsp;Regarding Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciating how Science and Technology have transformed the world and improved our lives. <br>
•	&nbsp;Seeing Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good of society.
</ul>
	
<u>INquire like Scientists</u><br>
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Having a strong foundation in Science, and possessing the spirit of scientific inquiry. <br>
•	&nbsp;Engaging confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment.<br>
•	&nbsp;Discerning, weighing alternatives and evaluating claims and ideas critically, based on logical scientific evidence and arguments, and yet being able to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence.
</ul>

<u>INnovate using Science</u><br>
<ul>
•	&nbsp;Applying and experiencing the potential of Science to generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday lives to complex problems affecting humanity. <br>
•	&nbsp;Making contributions towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise.
</ul>
