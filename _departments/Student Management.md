<u>Promote and Prevent</u>


•	&nbsp; Strong teacher-student relationships and quality instruction are at the centre of effective behaviour and classroom management. <br>
•	&nbsp; Challenging behaviours are prevented from occurring and disrupting learning through promoting a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, strengthening protective factors, and mitigating risk factors.

<u>Address and Correct</u>

•	&nbsp; Despite preventive measures, students may still display inappropriate behaviours due to various reasons. <br>
•	&nbsp; Addressing inappropriate behaviour promptly minimises disruptions to teaching and learning and correcting it ensures that students’ development and well-being will not be affected. <br>
•	&nbsp; Addressing the underlying reason(s) for inappropriate behaviour also results in sustainable behavioural change. 



<u>Replace and Restore </u>


•	&nbsp; The goal is for students to develop self-discipline and good character.<br>
•	&nbsp; Directing misbehaving students to replace their inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones.
•	&nbsp; Restoring relationships with others hurt by their actions. 
•	&nbsp; Encouraging habit formation via consistent positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviour and peer support.
