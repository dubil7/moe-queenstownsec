**<u>Author-in-Residence Programme</u>**

Author-in-Residence Programme is one of the signature programmes of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department. The objectives of the programme are to enhance students’ confidence in Chinese literary writing and to promote an appreciation of Chinese Literature among students.

In August, twenty Secondary Two talent students took part in the programme over a course of four sessions to learn Chinese song writing under the guidance of renowned local songwriter Wong Hong Mok. Mr Wong first introduced himself, followed by a song which he composed as well as the fundamentals of lyrics writing. Our students then worked in groups to compose new lyrics for the song. In the last session of the programme, students presented their new lyrics by singing along to Mr Wong’s guitar accompaniment.

Mr Wong’s engaging and interesting sharing had enabled our students to gain insight in song writing, especially in the aspect of lyrics writing. Charlene Toh Rui En of class 2A shared that “I had been looking forward to the programme as song writing is something I had not learnt before. Mr Wong’s teaching was fun and I could better appreciate Chinese lyrics as I listen to Chinese songs now.”

Apart from the Author-in-Residence Programme, the MTL Department is also focused in developing a love of reading among students. Our Reading Programme takes place every Thursday morning during assembly. During the reading sessions, our lower secondary students not only read classics but also curated works by local authors, while our upper secondary students read newspaper publications to be updated on current affairs. – by Soo Sien.
