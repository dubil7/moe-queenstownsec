Community Youth Leadership Programme
====================================

**Direct School Admission 2023**

**‘Dare to Serve – QUEST Community Youth Leaders’**

Established since 1956, Queenstown Secondary School prides itself as one of the pioneer schools in Singapore for providing quality education and nurturing students with values to excel in life. Our School’s Vision is for our students to be ‘Leaders for Tomorrow, Anchored in Values, and Committed to Serve’. They are imbued with the school’s core values of Resilience, Respect, Integrity, Care, and Excellence (R2ICE).&nbsp;

Our school develops responsible young leaders through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) that focuses on Community Youth Leadership (CYL). We have a well-established leadership and Values-in-Action (VIA) programme which integrates the Leadership Challenge Model, Design Thinking, and the Funnel Reflection Model. To provide an authentic learning experience, our students will have many opportunities to plan, organise and lead projects to serve their class, school, and the larger community. For example, our students collaborate with our partners, Lions Befrienders, Redhill Gardens RC, pupils from Lee Kong Chian Gardens School (MINDS) to serve the elderly citizens in the neighboring estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We endeavor to nurture our students to be future\-ready leaders who actively contribute to society. Thus, our students will graduate with the necessary leadership skills, knowledge, and dispositions, and attain at least an NYAA Silver Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We welcome students who are passionate and committed in leading and serving the community to participate in the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s **aptitudes** and **strengths**, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.&nbsp;

Successful applicants will have the privilege of participating in the school’s distinguished DSA Talent Development Programme. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;
