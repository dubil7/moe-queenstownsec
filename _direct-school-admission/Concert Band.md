**Direct School Admission 2023 (Concert Band)**

**QUEST Concert Band**

**“With Passion, We Can Succeed”**&nbsp; is our QTSS band motto. We started off with less than 30 members and have since grown steadily with double the numbers in recent years. The QTSS band has definitely come a long way and through our hard work, resilience, commitment and teamwork, we have found much success!&nbsp;

The QTSS Band has achieved Certificates of Distinction for consecutive SYF Arts Presentations since 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our comprehensive and rigorous band programme aims to build character, resilience, teamwork and discipline in every member while guiding them to understand and apply the basic foundation of making music. We aim to enrich our students’ experience through various internal and external performances such as band exchanges with other secondary school bands.&nbsp;

We welcome students who are passionate and committed to concert band to apply and participate in the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
