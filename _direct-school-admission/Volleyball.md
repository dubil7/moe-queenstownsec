**Direct School Admission 2022 – QUEST Volleyball**

**Our QUEST Volleyball**

Our QUEST Volleyball family aims to develop responsible and self-disciplined athletes through a rigorous training programme that focuses on imparting values and skills. The highlights of the training programme include umpiring training, beach volleyball competitions, Queen’s Cup (an annual friendly competition with Queensway Secondary School), National School Games (NSG) and our Volleyball bonding camp.

QUEST Volleyball has consistently achieved the top 4 placing in the South Zone for the annual National School Games. In 2021, despite the COVID-19 disruption, our B\-Division Girls emerged as South\-Zone Champions. In 2022, our B-Division Boys and C-Division Girls both clinched the South-Zone 2nd Runners\-Up positions. This year our B-Division Girls came in 3rd in the Zonal competition and played extremely well to reach the Nationals Quarterfinals.

We welcome students who are passionate and committed in volleyball to participate in the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
