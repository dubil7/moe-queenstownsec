Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is on Cultivating Minds for the Future based on the theme of **Sustainability**. We adopt an **interdisciplinary approach** driven mainly by **Geography** and **Science**. In this ALP, we aim to solve real-world geographical challenges through a scientific lens.   

Our school’s ALP adopts a thematic approach, where students explore three global geographical issues related to sustainability over three years, namely: 

Sec 1: Water Sustainability 

Sec 2: Urban and Energy Sustainability 

Sec 3: Food Sustainability
