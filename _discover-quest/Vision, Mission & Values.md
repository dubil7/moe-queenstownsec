**_Leaders for Tomorrow –_** <u>Tomorrow</u> refers to a future state that is marked by unpredictability – a “VUCA” environment that is Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. We aim to equip every student with the knowledge, skills and values to enable our students to be a leader who is reflective, passionate, adaptable, innovative and confident. With the knowledge, skills, values and leadership qualities, our students will be able to meet the demands of a “VUCA” environment and thrive in the future world.  

**_Anchored in Values –_** <u>Values</u> refer to the R2ISE values of Resilience, Respect, Integrity, Service and Excellence.   We aim to instil in our students the R2ISE values so that they will be able to make ‘right’ decisions in difficult and challenging situations.
