The School Crest consists of a shield with the school colors, sky Blue and maroon. The sky blue reflects the limitless opportunities to strive for and the maroon signifies the spirit of fraternity.

The open book symbolizes learning and knowledge, and the wheel symbolizes the technical aspect of education offered in the school. On the tower, which denotes strength, is the lion which signifies courage and from which Singapore derives its name.

Below the shield is a banner with the school motto “Berani Berkhidmat” written on it. The motto, which means “Dare To Serve”, is most appropriate at a time when our young independent Singapore requires men and women of courage to serve her and we are confident all Queenstownians will equal to the challenge that lies ahead.

**Pupils’ Creed**

We, Queenstownians, dare to serve,  
With self-respect,  
Working hand in hand,  
Together we build,  
Honest in performance,  
Taking pride in all tasks.

**School Song**

In Queenstown Secondary our minds are trained  
Our hands acquire the skill  
Whatever the task we’re here to serve  
We have the heart, the will

Queenstown Secondary the pioneer  
The school that leads the way  
In every field we do our best  
To learn, to work, to play

**(Chorus)**

Berani Berkhidmat, dare to serve  
Dare to do to be!  
Dare to serve – yes! with our hearts  
To keep our country free  
Berani Berkhidmat, dare to serve  
Dare to do to be!  
We dare to serve – yes! with our hearts  
To keep our country free
