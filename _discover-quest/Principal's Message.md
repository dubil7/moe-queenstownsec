Principal’s Message
===================


![](/images/P-SHC.jpg)


**<u><font size=5>Principal’s address 2023</font></u>**

**<u><font size=5>Welcome to Queenstown Secondary School!</font></u>**

<p align="justify">
Our nation has come a long way in the fight against COVID-19, and 2022 has been a year when the situation stabilised, allowing us to resume many key schooling experiences for our Queenstownians. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Through my interactions with members of the QTSS community – staff, Queenstownians, alumni, parents, and members of the School Advisory Committee — it is clear to me that our school is a well-loved one. We are blessed with a strong core of dedicated key personnel as well as teaching and non-teaching staff, many of who have been long-serving stewards. Unsurprisingly, I have fallen in love with our school and our school’s philosophy which places Queenstownians at the heart of all that we do. We believe in the unique worth of the individual, the enhancement of his well-being, and the symbiotic relation between himself and society.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This year, I had individual chats with every graduating Queenstownian to hear their dreams and hopes for the future. These conversations have been humbling and inspiring as students shared their myriad areas of interest that fuel their passion and their drive to improve things for themselves and others around them. Their zest for life and belief in themselves give me the confidence that they will eventually achieve success for themselves. 
</p>

Indeed, every individual is unique and brings with them different life experiences, passions, and strengths. Our school’s Total Curriculum embraces this and ensures that the holistic learning experiences of Queenstownians in the curricular and co-curricular domains, values education, and all supporting school programmes are aligned with the purpose of helping them to discover and nurture their gifts. Following the three approaches to connect, collaborate, and co-create, Queenstownians go through learning experiences to hone their interpersonal and intrapersonal skills to make sense of the fast-changing world around them. This is especially critical for secondary school students as they grow to become confident of who they are, what they value, and how they can value add to others.  
</p>
<p align="justify">
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the importance of preparing our Queenstownians for the future. Just a few weeks ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a powerful new chatbot that can perform a wide range of tasks, from creating software to generating ideas to writing assignments, at a quality on par or above what an average human can do. You can read more <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/12/chatgpt-is-a-tipping-point-for-ai"> here</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Being curious, I provided ChatGPT with the following instruction - Write a Singapore's school principal address on the school publicly facing website on preparing students for the future. Here is the ChatGPT output:
</p>

> Dear Students, Parents, and Community Members, <br>

> Welcome to our school's website. As the principal of this school in Singapore, I am proud to be part of a community that is dedicated to preparing our students for the future. <br>

> At our school, we believe in the importance of providing a well-rounded education that goes beyond just academic achievement. We strive to instill in our students the critical thinking skills, creativity, and global perspective needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and fast-paced world. <br>

> We are committed to providing our students with the tools and opportunities they need to pursue their passions and achieve their goals. From our state-of-the-art facilities and cutting-edge technology, to our extensive extracurricular activities and real-world learning experiences, we provide our students with a diverse range of opportunities to grow and learn. <br>

> I encourage you to explore our website to learn more about the exciting opportunities available at our school. If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please do not hesitate to contact us. <br>

> Sincerely, <br>
> [Principal's Name] <br>
> Principal, <br>
> [School Name] <br>

To my surprise, the few weeks old ChatGPT generated this output within seconds, one that is indeed of a similar quality to what a human could have written. I believe the quality of the output will only improve exponentially with wider and prolonged usage. In the face of such accelerated technological changes, it is hence increasingly paramount that our school’s Total Curriculum continues developing competences which are uniquely human and difficult for machines to replicate or obtain. Acquiring 21st Century Competencies like collaborative skills and critical thinking skills, as well as future literacies such as digital literacy and sustainability literacy will ensure that our Queenstownians are oriented for the future of learning and work. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Key to the effectiveness of our school’s Total Curriculum is our caring and enabling culture. One example of this is a school-wide peer support and buddy system through which Queenstownians care and look out for each other, and this was featured in the <a href="https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/helping-kids-feel-good-about-themselves"> Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Schoolbag newsletter</a>. We believe that strong teacher-student and student-student relationships are crucial in fostering a conducive environment for learning and growth for our Queenstownians. In our school, form teachers are referred to as Class Mentors because they take up the critical role of being significant adults in our students’ lives, and invest time to build strong relationships with Queenstownians so as to take care of their well-being, and guide them to be anchored in our school values. Queenstownians are also placed in the same mixed form classes throughout their years in our school, allowing them to build strong relationships with their Class Mentors and their classmates. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of well-being and building communities of support. I am driven to continue to strengthen the well-being of both our staff and Queenstownians as this collective care within our school community will help everyone emerge better and stronger. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Our school motto “Berani Berkhidmat – Dare to Serve” has had a significant impact on generations of Queenstownians, who seek to live out this call to service and leadership. I hope to further engage our staff and Queenstownians to understand their unique strengths and how they have been tapping on these gifts to serve our larger community, to make our world a better and brighter place for others. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
I look forward to journeying through 2023 with our QTSS community!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely yours,<br>
	
Mr Sim How Chong<br> 

Principal
