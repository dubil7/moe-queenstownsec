**<u><font size=5>Principal’s address 2022</font></u>**

**<u><font size=5>Welcome to Queenstown Secondary School!</font></u>**

It is with great joy that I join Queenstown Secondary School, a school with a long history and rich heritage; taking over the mantle from Mdm Rasidah Bte Rahim where I seek to continue her impactful work. Under her leadership, our school has broadened the definition of success for our students, known affectionately as Queenstownians. I was fortunate to join our school earlier as the Principal-Designate where I had the opportunity to interact with staff, students, alumni, parents, and members of the School Advisory Committee. Through these interactions, it became clear to me that our school is a well-loved school, blessed with a strong core of dedicated key personnel, teaching, as well as non-teaching staff, many of whom have been long serving stewards.

Our school’s philosophy places each and every Queenstownian at the heart of all that we do, where we believe in the unique worth of the individual, the enhancement of his well-being, and symbiotic relation between himself and society.

Every individual is unique and brings with them different life experiences, passions, and strengths. The school’s total curriculum embraces this. As such, the academic subjects taught in our classrooms and beyond, our co-curricular activities, values education and all supporting programmes are designed to help our students to discover and nurture their gifts. This is especially critical for secondary school students, as they grow to become confident of who they are and what they value.

In our school, form teachers are referred to as class mentors because they take up this critical role of being a significant adult in our students’ lives. Our class mentors invest time to build a strong relationship with the Queenstownians under their charge so as to take care of their well-being, and guide them to be anchored in our school values. Our school has also implemented a school-wide peer support and buddy system where Queenstownians care and look out for each other. These efforts are part of our school’s caring and enabling culture, which was featured in the [Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Schoolbag](https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/helping-kids-feel-good-about-themselves).

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the significance of well-being and the importance of building communities of support. As my committed colleagues put in the extra effort to take care of our Queenstownians during this pandemic, the school has also put in measures, e.g. a staff buddy system, to take care of staff well-being. Moving forward, I am keen to enhance the well-being of both our teachers and students as I believe that this collective care within our school community will eventually help everyone emerge stronger.

In my conversations with various alumni, it was also clear to me that the school motto “Berani Berkhidmat – Dare to Serve” has had a significant impact on generations of Queenstownians, who seek to live out this call to service and leadership. It is my hope that every staff and student will always have the courage to tap on their gifts to serve our larger community, to make our world a better and brighter place for others.

I look forward to meeting everyone soon, to hear your dreams and hopes for our school!

Yours sincerely,

Mr Sim How Chong  
Principal
