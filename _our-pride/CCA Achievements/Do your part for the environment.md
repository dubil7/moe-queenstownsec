Do your part for the environment
================================

You can do your part for the environment by practising the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle)

### Reduce

1.  Minimise Food Waste
    *   Plan your grocery shopping trips and buy only as much as you can eat or cook.
    *   Store any leftovers and consume them before they spoil.
    *   Prepare and cook only what you need for consumption.
    *   Order or take just enough food when eating out.
    *   Ask for less noodles or rice if you know you cannot finish the food.

2.  Avoid the use of disposable products
    *   Use rechargeable batteries instead of non-rechargeable ones.
    *   Bring along a reusable bag with you on shopping trips.
    *   Ask for non-disposable cutlery when eating out. Bring your own containers and utensils for take-aways.
    *   Use cloth to clean your table instead of paper towels.
    *   Minimise the use of disposable diapers; use cloth diapers instead.
    *   Use handkerchief instead of tissue paper.

3.  Buy products with less packaging
    *   Buy household products that are used frequently in large or economy-sized packaging.
    *   Buy refill packs for your cleaning and personal care products.
    *   Choose products with less packaging.
    *   Support products with packaging made from recycled and reused material.
    *   Choose packaging that are reusable or recyclable.
    *   Instead of bottled water, choose refillable bottles and refill with tap water.

### **Reuse**

1.  Reusing paper

Before you crush that scrap paper / gift wrapper in your hand, why not

*   Make notepaper for shopping lists, etc
*   Use it again as wrapping paper?
*   Make it into a paper container to hold small things like paper clips or thumbtacks? (Organise your stuff!)

2.  Reusing glass bottles

Empty glass bottles can come in handy. Try these simple ideas.

*   If you have leftover food, it can be stored in widenecked jars such as coffee or jam jars.
*   When your spices, herbs or sauces run out, instead of buying a new glass bottle, you could just buy refills.
*   Simply punch holes into the metal cap of the jar and you could have a customised pepper/salt shaker.
*   Rather than a conventional pot, you could opt to use a glass bottle to grow your plants and/or shrubs.
*   Interesting shaped glass bottles have the potential to be used as vases.

3.  Reusing plastic bags
    *   They can be reused for your shopping trips.
    *   They are perfect for lining household dustbins as trash bags.

4.  Reusing plastic containers
    *   Use them for storage of food, loose items, etc. instead of buying new containers for storage.

5.  Other ideas on reusing
    *   Look out for charity projects where used textbooks donated by the public are redistributed to needy students.
    *   Give old textbooks to your juniors in the school.
    *   Donate used appliances to charity organisations.
    *   Auction used appliances off on the Internet.
    *   Trade the old appliances for something else on the Internet.
    *   Reuse the fabrics from old clothes by cutting them up into rags for cleaning.
    *   Donate old clothes to charity organisations.
    *   Hold a clothes-swapping party and take the chance to refresh your wardrobe and get rid of unwanted pieces.

### **Recycle**

1.  Items which can be recycled
    *   Paper
    *   Glass
    *   Metal
    *   Cans
    *   Clothes
    *   Plastic

2.  Items that cannot be recycled
    *   Paper that has been contaminated with food waste, used tissue paper and sweet wrappers.
    *   Used styrofoam and disposable plastic cups/containers.
    *   Cassette tapes
    *   Light bulbs and window glass
    *   Ceramic and porcelain items

3.  Now that you know what to recycle, remember to practise the 5 steps of proper recycling!

STEP 1: Recycle paper, plastic, metal, glass and old clothing

STEP 2: Empty recyclable containers of their contents

STEP 3: Deposit recyclables into recycling bins instead of leaving them outside.

STEP 4: Do not deposit food waste and non-recyclables into recycling bins.

STEP 5: Do not dispose bulky items like furniture and renovation waste at recycling bins.
