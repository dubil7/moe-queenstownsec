Np Bca Design Challenge

Our students participated in the NP-BCA Design Challenge and was awarded the Merit Award.

Earth Hour started as a symbolic lights out event in Sydney in 2007 and is now the world’s largest grassroots movement for the environment, inspiring millions of people to take action for our planet and nature.

Our teachers did a presentation to our students during the class contact time to spread the meaning behind conserving energy and Earth Hour. Lights and fans were switched off during the first period to observe Earth Hour. The activity also serves to let the students experience life without electricity. Some of our teachers made use of the opportunity to conduct lessons outdoor.
