Exhibition Panels from EMA

Energy Market Authority (EMA) put up exhibition panels in the school training room as well as the foyer for one week. Through the exhibition panels, the Singapore’s Energy Story (less known to all) – challenges, current development and possible opportunities was shown to our students. To deepen the learning of the students, a worksheet based on the exhibition was designed for the students to complete.
