The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Queenstown Secondary School leverages on 2 things to nurture all Queenstownians as Community Youth Leaders:

1.  our rich heritage and belief in serving the community, and
2.  our strength in nurturing leadership qualities.

We seek to grow specifically in our students the competencies in emotional quotient (EQ), cultural quotient (CQ) and adversity quotient (AQ). We leverage on the Kolb’s (1975) Model of Learning to strengthen our students’ experiential learning in the various NYAA platforms, with carefully chosen experiences for reflection and critical analysis, synthesis and decision-making.
