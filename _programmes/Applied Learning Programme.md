Applied Learning Programme
==========================

**Geography and Science**
-------------------------

Queenstown Secondary is one of the few schools in Singapore, which has in place the interdisciplinary (Geography and Science) Applied Learning Programme (ALP), first mentioned by the Minister of Education during the workplan seminar in 2013. The ALP alongside other programmes like Learning for Life Programme, are part of the blueprint of a good secondary school.  
Leveraging on Howard Gardner’s theory on 5 Minds for the Future, the aims of the Quest ALP are:

Students will be able to

1.  acquire inquiry skills via the **QUEST Approach** (**Disciplined Mind);**
2.  connect knowledge and skills learnt in Geography and Science as a continuum (**Synthesising Mind**);
3.  apply and extend these knowledge and understanding to explain and possess the wisdom to **solve real-world problems** (**Creating, Respectful and Ethical Mind**).

Equipped with the 5 Minds through the ALP programme, our students will be more ready to face the future, which is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.

At the end of the programme, students will become responsible and active citizens who are well informed and concerned of environmental issues impacting Singapore and our neighbours.

As an extension to our environment sustainability education, our school also provides opportunities to promote active student student participation in building an environmentally conscious community.

Below shows the list of programme and activities conducted for our ALP and environment sustainability education.
